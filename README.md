## About

This project is focused on learning and training. The purpose is to create components, communicate with each other and incorporate buttons to go forward and backward while visualizing breadcrums.
For this project, is about the creation for an ecological transport company that wants to show its products and their characteristics as well as their transport.
The application contains a home page, a menu where you can see all the products in which you can access each one individually and see its own characteristics.
You will also have a menu where you can see your fleet of trucks, your type of truck with its characteristics and its routes.
I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I have enjoyed creating it, thank you very much!
